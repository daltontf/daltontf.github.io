Liberty North won the boys and combined/coed categories mainly by winning baseball and girls soccer championships within minutes of each other on June 4th.

Incarnate Word had the best girls sports performance by winning state in basketball (as usual), a runner-up finish in volleyball along with quarterfinal appearances in softball and soccer.

I realized that I should be splitting third and fourth place points between teams where there was no 3rd place/consolation game (football this year). Teams should be getting 27 points, (30 + 24) / 2, instead of 24.
