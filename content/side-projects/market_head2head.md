The idea started when I was watching St. Louis CITY SC play its first MLS match vs the Portland Timbers. I wondering to myself if this was the first time that a professional sports team from St. Louis had ever faced a team from Portland. Portland only has an NBA teams and St. Louis hasn't had an NBA team since 1968.[^1]

One can include anchors in the URL to directly display two markets:

Notes:

- This is a side-project and so there are limits due to the simplicity of the approach to associating teams with markets. What market a team represents is based on the name. Some markets are "sub-markets" and team names may have the name of the larger market:

  - The Golden State Warriors are considered to be a San Francisco team despite playing in Oakland for a while. 

  - The Angels of the MLB have been based in Anaheim since 1966, but have only incorporated "Anaheim" in the the name from 1997 to 2015. 

- What leagues are included don't follow a specific criteria. 
If a league had enough markets that are now "major" markets and there was results to be found, it was considered for inclusion. Attendance and whether the league is "national" in nature (spanning timezones).

  - Currently only five sports (football, baseball, basketball, hockey and soccer) plus "derivatives" (i.e. arena football or indoor soccer) are included. That is probably change to include sports like lacrosse and volleyball.

  - Currently, the "Original Six" era of the NHL has yet to be added. One can make a case that the league wasn't "national" enough, but it will eventually get added.
