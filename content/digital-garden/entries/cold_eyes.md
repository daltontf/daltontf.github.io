Another story involving an "eye ball" planet this one is a "super-earth" where fairly advanced inhabitants can't escape the gravity well due also to the lack of heavy element like uranium. The only technology they have is chemical rockets and they are trapped due to the "rocket equation"[^1]. 

Science fiction starts somewhat hard (except the concept of transferring your knowledge into a younger clone). Does introduce sentient aliens that learned English by intercepting our radio communication.
