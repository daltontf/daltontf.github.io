Another story that involves happens to be set in Tau Ceti.
 Feels like a combination of "Interstellar" (mission to save humanity from extinction type event) and "The Martian" (guy solving problem after problem). 
 
 Science fiction pretty solid even with "astrophage" being a bit of a plot convenience [^1]. A first contact with a alien from a "super earth" with 300 degree surface temperature that breathes ammonia is an innovative idea has opposed to aliens that just happen to live on planets with Earth-like atmosphere and gravity.
