This story involves "solar sails" that are considered harder science fiction than say warp drives or hyperspace since it is a real concept being studied. Involves alien "refugees" who've "managed" to cause their star to go nova, so it is even softer that Proxima. 

This was not quite the story I was looking for. I think a story that ponders what it the "right thing" to do for the more "advanced" culture to do without falling in the traps that happened in our past with our various colonel empires that tended to exploit the less "advanced" cultures.

Here the aliens are a little bit more advanced than humans, but are more refugees than would be colonizers.
