I had this idea of finding a hard science fiction story set on an "eye ball" planet (One that is tidally locked to its star). This book is set on a such planet orbiting Proxima Centauri. This book was written shortly before the discovery of [Proxima B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b), so that adds another bit of scientific realism. 

A bit softer of the hardness scale with sentient primitive aliens on the planet, the "[kernels](https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/AppliedPhlebotinum?from=Main.Phlebotinum)" and portals to and from Mercury.

Included was excerpt from the sequel, Ultima, which included "Space Romans" in some kind of alternate history. That did not interest me. Overall, a decent read, but didn't like that much of a mark on me.
