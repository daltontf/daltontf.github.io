*This is the my "official" first post. The "blog" is for me to get practice on communicating thoughts into written words which is something that I struggle with. I'm in my 50s now, so it is about time. The subjects will tend to be my current interests, mostly technical / nerdy things. I going kick off with some thoughts on books I've read recently.*

One genre I gravitate towards is "hard" science fiction. Hard science fiction strives for a certain amount of plausibility in depicting science fiction concepts. TV Tropes has a good description here, https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/SlidingScale/MohsScaleofScienceFictionHardness. 

The pattern that I've noticed that hard science fiction usually gets softer as the story goes on. This is often necessary because too much realism can be not as interesting. Speculating on what would happen if one seemingly fantastical technology was possible or what first contact some kind of extraterrestrial intelligence can make things more thought provoking.

The is the first post about a book I have recently read. There will be hopefully minor spoilers

## "Proxima" by Stephen Baxter

I had this idea of finding a hard science fiction story set on an "eye ball" planet (One that is tidally locked to its star). This book is set on a such planet orbiting Proxima Centauri (Book was written shortly before the discovery of [Proxima B](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxima_Centauri_b)) 

A bit softer of the hardness scale with somewhat sentient primitive aliens on the planet, the "kernels[^1]" and portals to and from Mercury.

Included was excerpt from the sequel, Ultima, which included "Space Romans". That did not interest me.
