        <p>The idea started in 2023 when I was watching St. Louis CITY SC play its first MLS match vs the Portland Timbers. I was wondering to myself if this was the first time that a professional sports team from St. Louis had ever faced a team from Portland. Portland only has an NBA team and St. Louis hasn't had an NBA team since 1968.Maybe teams played previously in what is a now defunct league?<sup class="footnote-reference"><a href="#1">1</a></sup> </p>
<p>I had become familiar with the ESPN API when writing my &quot;roScore&quot; Roku App&quot; <a href="https://github.com/daltontf/roScore">https://github.com/daltontf/roScore</a> and developed scripts to storing such data in MySQL database. Over time I had to find other sources of older and more obscure results like <a href="https://retrosheet.org/">https://retrosheet.org/</a>, <a href="https://www.hockeydb.com">https://www.hockeydb.com</a> and sometimes just copying out of Wikipedia. </p>
<p>Here is the link to the page:</p>
<p><a href="https://daltontf.github.io/market_head2head.html">https://daltontf.github.io/market_head2head.html</a></p>
<p>One can include anchors in the URL to directly display two markets:</p>
<p><a href="https://daltontf.github.io/market_head2head.html#KCvSTL">https://daltontf.github.io/market_head2head.html#KCvSTL</a></p>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>This is a side-project and so there are limits due to the simplicity of the approach to associating teams with markets. What market a team represents is based on the name. Some markets are &quot;sub-markets&quot; and team names may have the name of the larger market:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Golden State Warriors are considered to be a San Francisco team despite playing in Oakland for a while. </li>
<li>Same with New York teams that play in New Jersey. A team is considered a New Jersey team if it is the name.</li>
<li>The Angels of the MLB have been based in Anaheim since 1966, but have only incorporated &quot;Anaheim&quot; in the the name from 1997 to 2015. </li>
</ul>
<p>Update: Since the Angels have been in Anaheim their entire existence including when they were the &quot;Los Angeles Angels&quot;, it is now excluded from being a &quot;Los Angeles&quot; team and is associated with Anaheim.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What leagues are included don't follow a specific criteria. 
If a league had enough markets that are now &quot;major&quot; markets and there was results to be found, it was considered for inclusion. attendance and whether the league is &quot;national&quot; in nature (spanning time zones) also makes a league closer to &quot;major&quot; than others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initially only five sports (football, baseball, basketball, hockey and soccer) plus &quot;derivatives&quot; (i.e. arena football or indoor soccer) are included. Recently sports like lacrosse, rugby and volleyball have been added.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Known Data Gaps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Currently, the &quot;Original Six&quot; era of the NHL has yet to be added. One can make a case that the league wasn't &quot;national&quot; enough, but it will eventually get added.</li>
<li>The International Hockey League had some large markets particularly in the '90s. I couldn't find &quot;scrape-able&quot; data before 1995. The IHL didn't feature significant major markets until several years before.</li>
<li>I only have Negro Leagues data from 1939-1948.</li>
<li>Since the second incarnation of the USFL prior to merger with the XFL to form the UFL used a hub-model and most teams never actually played in the markets, they've are omitted.</li>
</ul>

<p>Turns out that the St. Louis Stars of the North American Soccer League had played against earlier incarnation of the Timbers.</p>
