    <title>STLToday High School Sport Stats DB - About</title>
</head>
<body>
<p>This past year my daughter was approaching a milestone in one of her high school sports. I ended up going to the
  STLToday High School Sport Stats page <a href="https://www.stltoday.com/sports/high-school/stats/#tracking-source=main-nav">https://www.stltoday.com/sports/high-school/stats/#tracking-source=main-nav</a>
  and copy pasting data from into a Google Sheet and creating some queries to sum up the stats. She had classmates that
  played other sports who were coming up on milestones so I did likewise for those sports. When us software developers
  find ourselves doing something manually over and over, we seek ways to automate it. I once had contract gig where I wrote software to scrape data from various sources like
  spreadsheets and PDFs and store it in a database, scraping web pages can be relatively easy. If I can do it for one school,
  I can do it for all schools and sports STLToday has stats for.
</p>
<p>
  Now I have this data, I would be nice to share it with others, so this little web page thingy was created.
